The complete Java version of the TDD micro-exercises and of the proposed solution soon available, porting underway by [Peter Rhys Thomas] (https://github.com/peterrhysthomas).
Thanks to [Emily Bache] (https://github.com/emilybache) for the Python version of the exercises. Also the porting of the exercises is Ruby underway by [Sam Serpoosh] (https://github.com/Sam-Serpoosh). Thank you!

If you want to contribute to the porting of the exercises and the proposed solutions, looks at the original C# version for strong-type languages and at the JavaScript version for dynamic languages.
